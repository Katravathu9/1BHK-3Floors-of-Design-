This project showcases a professional 1BHK residential design that integrates AutoCAD for 2D drafting and Revit for 3D BIM modeling to ensure architectural precision.This project showcases a professional 1BHK residential design that integrates AutoCAD for 2D drafting and Revit for 3D BIM modeling to ensure architectural precision. It emphasizes technical compliance by utilizing Excel for RERA-mandated carpet area calculations and adhering to Building Bye-laws for optimal ventilation and ceiling heights. Furthermore, the layout is strategically aligned with Vastu Shastra principles, such as positioning the kitchen in the South-East and the master bedroom in the South-West  
Designing a 1BHK (1 Bedroom, Hall, Kitchen) unit involves a mix of creative drafting, legal compliance, and technical data management. By integrating **AutoCAD** for precision, **Revit** for 3D coordination, and **Excel** for data tracking, you can ensure your project meets **RERA** and **Vastu** standards.

## 1. The 1BHK Design Brief (Standard Requirements)

A typical 1BHK unit ranges from **450 to 650 sq. ft.** (Carpet Area).

* **Living Room (Hall):** Minimum  for comfortable seating and circulation.
* **Bedroom:** Minimum  to accommodate a queen-sized bed and wardrobe.
* **Kitchen:** Minimum  for a "working triangle" (stove, sink, fridge).
* **Toilet/Bath:** Minimum  (combined) or  (separate WC).

---

## 2. Technical Workflow: AutoCAD, Revit, & Excel

To set units to feet in both CAD and Revit:

* **AutoCAD:** Type `UNITS`  Change "Length Type" to **Architectural**  Set "Insertion Scale" to **Inches/Feet**.
* **Revit:** Type `UN`  Change "Length" to **Feet and fractional inches**.

| Software | Primary Purpose for 1BHK | Key Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **AutoCAD** | Precision 2D drafting and submission drawings. | Use `OFFSET` for 9" external and 4.5" internal walls. |
| **Revit** | 3D modeling and BIM (Building Information Modeling). | Create "Room Tags" to automatically calculate area. |
| **Excel** | Costing, RERA area schedules, and material takeoff. | Use formulas to calculate **Total Carpet Area vs. Built-up Area**. |

## 3. Regulatory & Traditional Guidelines

### **RERA (Real Estate Regulatory Authority)**

* **Carpet Area:** You must disclose the *actual usable area* within the walls. Balconies and external walls are excluded from this calculation.
* **Transparency:** Use **Excel** to create a comparative sheet of the sanctioned plan vs. the proposed plan to ensure no deviations exceed 5% without buyer consent.

### **Building Bye-Laws**

* **Ventilation:** Every habitable room must have window openings equal to at least **10% of the floor area**.
* **Ceiling Height:** Standard minimum height is **9 feet**.
* **Setbacks:** Maintain the mandatory open space (Front, Rear, and Sides) as per your local municipal authority.

### **Vastu Shastra Principles**

* **Entrance:** Best in **North, East, or North-East**. Avoid South-West.
* **Kitchen:** Ideally in the **South-East** (Agni/Fire zone). The person cooking should face East.
* **Master Bedroom:** Locate in the **South-West** for stability and peace.
* **Toilet:** Best in the **North-West** or **West**; never in the North-East or center of the house.

## 4. Pro-Tips for Implementation

* **In Revit:** Use the **Schedule/Quantities** tool to export your room areas directly to **Excel**. This ensures your RERA filings are 100% accurate to the drawing.
* **In AutoCAD:** Use "Layers" for Vastu (e.g., a non-printing layer to check the *Brahmasthan* or center point of the flat).
